            <p>
                Devi would have to walk miles to help her mom clean dishes and get clean water to make food. Sometimes having to use unsanitary water when there was a water shortage, Devi found it hard to keep dirty dishes sanitary. She and her family were more at risk to get sick due to using suck water on food and dishes. Now Devi and her mother no longer need to walk miles and do not need to worry about getting sick from unsanitary water through our help.
